Templates
=========

Various templates.

## Latex
A report template with support for the packages I use the most. Most noticeably it offers a custom header and footer as well as a default listing configuration for including source code. 

A pretty basic *Ilmenau* themed beamer template. 

## Markdown
Not really a template but a style sheet for markdown generated HTML. Since I'm continuously tweaking and improving it I decided to put it under version control.
